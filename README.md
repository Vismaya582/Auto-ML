# Auto-ML
This project is an interactive AutoML agent that lets users build, analyze, and deploy machine learning models using natural language. It combines a Streamlit frontend with a FastAPI backend, powered by PyCaret and LLMs (Groq Llama3), to automate the entire ML workflowâ€”no coding required.
