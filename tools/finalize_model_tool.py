    """
    Finalizes the best available model by retraining it on the full dataset.

    This tool is the last training step before saving a model for production. It
    intelligently selects the most refined model from the state (ensemble > tuned > best > created)
    and trains it on 100% of the data to maximize performance.

    This tool is applicable only for classification and regression tasks.

    Args:
        state (MLState): The current state of the ML pipeline, which must include a
                         completed setup and at least one trained model.

    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing the `final_model` object and the
                        `last_output` message to update the state.
